Hi {teacher_first_name},

This is an automated email to remind you of the upcoming classes you are scheduled to teach at Asmbly.
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the community!

{pretty_events}

Please note these are the registrations as of the time of this email and may not reflect final registrations for your class.
You can see more details about these events and registrants in your Neon backend account.  
The login URL is https://asmbly.z2systems.com/np/admin/content/contentList.do
Email classes@asmbly.org if you have any questions about the above schedule.

\t* Note: Some registrants are purchased under a single account and thus end up with the same email and phone number.


Thanks again!
